### Overview
How often do you forget that one of your favorite bars or restaurants has a special today?  Or that the little corner bar or restaurant has bingo or trivia today? Solution: the MeetUpMenu.  The MeetUpMenu will allow you to store your favorite local specials, based on a recurring weekly schedule.
